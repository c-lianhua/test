hello rain!


#install Git
	
	When you use the Git first time at linux you can use the instruction like:

	sudo apt-get install git


#add user and email
	
	Git describe each as userName and email,so before start you should 'login' user the following instructor:

	git config --global user.name "your name"
	git config --global user.email "email addr"

	!-Note: use the --global parameter means all the repository will user the name and email



#mkdir repository

	Use the repository you can manager you file more easy:

	first make the folder: mkdir rain
	then go into the folder: cd rain
	next init the folder: git init



#use git
	
!-Key point:
	Before manager the  project we should know the three concept:
	
	--Working Directory: is more near to us,show as the folder
	--Stage or Index: we can add many file to the stage before we commit
	--Repository: all the commit version storege in the repository



	#add the project contains three step:
		
		1.modify the file
		2.git add fileName (add the one or many file to Stage)
		3.git commit -m "describe this version or how to modify"
	
		eache step you can use 'git status' show the status
	
	
	#go into any version
	
	there are two instructor support us to time-travel:
	
	--git log: show the early version
	--git reflog: show all version
	
	a little different from add,get go into the history version include three grade:

		1.git reset --hard version (you born in the historical version)
		2.git reset HEAD file (reset the courrent historical background to HEAD) 
		3.git checkout -- file (you born in courrent historical)
	
	#rm the special file:

		1.rm file (rm local file)
		2.git rm file (ready to rm repository file)
		3.git commit -m "describe" (update the modify whith the instructor in Stage)


#connection to the GitHub
	
	when you want to put your file to the GitHub for more person to use,first you should do is to connect to yourself or other person GitHub. but how?
	
	1.ssh-keygen -t rse -C "yourEmail@example.com" (create ssh key)
	2.if success there is a .ssh folder at main catalog and go into the folder
	3.open the file 'id_rsa.pub' and copy the content
	4.login GitHub go to the setting/key(SSH and GPG keys) to add the key

#use GitHub repository

	after connection	





using :
	git biff;
	git add file;
	git commit  -m "descirbe";
	git reset --hard version;
	git reset HEAD "file";
	git checlout -- file;
	rm and git rm and git commit -m version;
	ok;
